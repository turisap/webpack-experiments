# Configuring webpack 4 from scratch

## What is done
I made this configuration with certain goals in mind, namely:

* css autoprefixing
* code spliting using `@loadable/component`
* `typescript` optimization
* HMR for styles and js
* production builds optimizations

I used `create-react-app` as my inspiration source
